A simple inkscape extension to crop all PATHS outside of page i made because of perfomance issues when trying to export a part of image with paths with lots of elements

put in {INKSACPE PATH}/extensions/

will appear under extensions > custom > mass crop to page

there are also two other utilities:
- Convert Layer Children to Groups - it will convert all children of the selected layer that are layers to be groups instad (so they can be selected invidiually)
- Flatten Groups and Layers - will take all children of the selected objects and if they are groups or layers will make them siblings of the object instead
